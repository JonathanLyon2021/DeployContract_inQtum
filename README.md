# DeployContract_inQtum
This is Exercise 18 from MI4 in Kingsland Universities Blockchain Developer Program

# Goals 
In this exercise, you will deploy a simple Smart Contract in Qtum’s Regtest mode.
To deploy a contract, you will need the contract's *bytecode* and *ABI*, generated using *solc*.
Finally, you’ll invoke its methods in JavaScript using *qweb3.js*.

# Prerequisites
Throughout the project, we will use:
• Solidity v0.6.4 (solc)
• Qtum v0.19.0.1 (https://github.com/qtumproject/qtum/releases/tag/mainnet-ignition-v0.19.0)
• QWeb3 v1.2.2
• NodeJS v13.5.0
